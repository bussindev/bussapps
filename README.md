# bussapps
Apps that buss, just like me.
As always, it's Python. But I've used PyInstaller to convert the Python file to an executable (.exe) file. 
Releases aren't actually releases. Each release has a different app. Release 1 has an app, Release 2 has a different app.
But Release 1.1 will have the Release 1 app, but updated.
I'll upload cool apps with bussy names.
